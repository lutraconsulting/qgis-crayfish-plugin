    1.0 - Bug fixes for issues seen in 0.1
        Support for downloading viewer library from behind proxy server
        Fixes for annoying bugs:
            Error seen when unloading any non-crayfish layer.
            Layer not automatically redrawn when changing contour 
            settings.
            Improved contour options behaviour.
            Made contours optional.
            Last rendered dataset now remembered (instead of always 
            defaulting to bed elevation).
            Removed unnessisary warning messages.
            Fixed stacked widget in vector options (min/max line edits 
            not displayed properly).
            Updated styles in about page.
            Better handling of errors when loading layers.
            Fixed memory leaks.
            Fixed issue when datasets other than the first loaded do 
            not behave as expected.
            Ensured only a single vector options dialog can be opened.
            Added better support for handing allocation errors for huge 
            layers.
